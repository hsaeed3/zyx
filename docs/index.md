## What is ZYX?

<span class="zyx-glitch">ZYX</span> is a *creativity-first* SDK for building context-aware applications and workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs), and provides many high-level abstractions for making patterns such as **tool use**, **context chaining**, **agentic memories & orchestration**, extremely easy to implement and customize.

The library sits quite comfortably on the back of [**Instructor**](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) (for generating type-safe structured outputs), and quite literally cannot exist
without it.

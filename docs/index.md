!!! note "What is `ZYX`?"

    `ZYX` is a simplicity-first library wrapped on top of [Pydantic AI] and heavily inspired by [Marvin]. It aims to provide a simple, *stdlib-like* interface for working with language models, without loss of control as well as flexibility that more complex frameworks provide.

# zyx - a fun & expressive sdk for context engineering

`zyx` is a simple Python package for context management in Language Model & AI Agent-Driven
Applications. It is heavily built off of the back of [Instructor](https://github.com/jxml/instructor) and
provides a simple and intuitive interface for:

- Generating Structured Outputs
- Tool Use & Composable Agentic Behavior
- Graph-Like Workflows & Context Management

!!! note

    Currently, I am still working on finalizing the interface of `zyx`, so further documentation and examples
    will be available soon. In the meantime, this document should be sufficient to hit the ground running.

## Installation

You can install `zyx` via pip:

```bash
pip install zyx

# or use `uv`
# uv pip install zyx
# uv add zyx
```

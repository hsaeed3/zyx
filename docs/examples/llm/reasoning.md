# **Reasoning Based Functions**

<code>zyx</code> provides a way to create reasoning based functions, which can be used to solve complex problems. 

The following papers were implemented when creating these functions:

            description='Based on the evaluation: After evaluating the three approaches to solving the puzzle, the 
most promising approach is the Constraint Propagation method. This approach effectively narrows down the 
possibilities for each empty cell, which can lead to a quicker solution in many cases. The outcomes for each 
approach are as follows: 1. **Backtracking Algorithm**: - **Best-case**: Quick solution with minimal backtracking. 
- **Average-case**: Moderate backtracking required, leading to a solution after several iterations. - 
**Worst-case**: Lengthy solving process due to excessive backtracking. 2. **Constraint Propagation**: - 
**Best-case**: Unique solution found quickly without guessing. - **Average-case**: Constraints reduce possibilities
but still require some guessing or backtracking. - **Worst-case**: Minimal reduction in possibilities, leading to a
lengthy solving process. 3. **Human-like Techniques**: - **Best-case**: Quick identification of placements, solving
the puzzle easily. - **Average-case**: Some progress made, but complex strategies needed to finish. - 
**Worst-case**: Solver gets stuck and cannot find a solution without algorithmic methods. Given these evaluations, 
the Constraint Propagation method stands out as it can lead to a unique solution efficiently, minimizing the need 
for guessing and backtracking. To implement the Constraint Propagation approach, the following detailed, actionable
tasks can be outlined: 1. **Analyze the Initial Puzzle State**: Identify all empty cells and the current numbers in
the grid to establish initial constraints. 2. **Apply Constraint Rules**: For each empty cell, apply Sudoku rules 
to eliminate impossible numbers based on existing numbers in the same row, column, and box. 3. **Update 
Possibilities**: Continuously update the list of possible numbers for each empty cell as constraints are applied. 
4. **Identify Unique Candidates**: Look for cells that have only one possible number left and fill them in, further
reducing possibilities for other cells. 5. **Iterate Until Completion**: Repeat the process of applying constraints
and filling in unique candidates until the puzzle is solved or no further progress can be made.',

            feedback="The current answer provided for the Sudoku puzzle is incorrect. The solution does not adhere 
to the rules of Sudoku, where each number from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 
subgrid. For example, in the first row, the number '8' is repeated, and in the second row, the number '3' is also 
repeated. Additionally, the solution does not match the original puzzle's constraints, as several numbers do not 
align with the given clues. It is essential to double-check the solution process and ensure that the final answer 
meets all Sudoku requirements. A step-by-step approach to solving the puzzle could also enhance understanding and 
verification of the solution."

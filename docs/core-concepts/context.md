# Context & Prompting

This section covers the basics of context management and prompting techniques used in `ZYX`. Understanding this concept is crucial for effectively utilizing the framework's contextual capabilities.

## What is Context in `ZYX`?

`ZYX` takes a slightly different approach to context compared to traditional LLM and agentic frameworks. In `ZYX`, **context** refers to the parameter used within semantic operations to provide:

- **Prompts**: Instructions or questions given to the language model.
- **Messages**: Conversational history or exchanges that inform the model's responses.
- **'_Snippets_' of Data**: Relevant pieces of information such as images, documents and other data types that can be used to enrich the model's understanding.

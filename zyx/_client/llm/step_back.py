    Implements the Step-Back prompting technique to solve problems by first considering high-level concepts.

    Example:
        ```python
        result = zyx.step_back("What is the significance of the Pythagorean theorem in mathematics?")
        print(f"High-level concept: {result.high_level_concept}")
        print(f"Final answer: {result.final_answer}")
        ```

    Parameters:
        problem (str): The problem to solve.
        model (str): The model to use for generation.
        api_key (Optional[str]): The API key to use for generation.
        base_url (Optional[str]): The base URL to use for generation.
        organization (Optional[str]): The organization to use for generation.
        max_tokens (Optional[int]): The maximum number of tokens to generate.
        max_retries (int): The maximum number of retries to make.
        temperature (float): The temperature to use for generation.
        mode (Literal["json", "md_json", "tools"]): The mode to use for generation.
        verbose (bool): Whether to print verbose output.

    Returns:
        StepBackResult: The high-level concept and the final answer.
